            How many sunflowers would you need to plant in order to get rid of the radioactive isotopes that are byproduct of your use of electricity?</font></h2>

            After the nuclear disasters at Chernobyl(Ukraine) and Fukushima(Japan), many countries planted sunflowers to absorb these radioactive isotopes.
            By doing this, the number of acidic rain and toxic wind plummeted in a short time span. 
            Even though a sunflower absorbs a small quantity, planting hectares of this multi-use plant, helped reduce the scale of this disaster by a significant percentage. Sunflowers can take up high concentrations of radioactive isotopes and sequester them in stems and leaves, so they have been employed to clean up contaminated sites following nuclear disasters. And so we thought that if they can be used for atomic disasters, why not use them for nuclear waste? Even though nuclear power plants have low to no carbon emission, they produce nuclear waste which is very harmful to both the environment and the human body. Disposing of this toxic waste will help get rid of the problems that come with containing this hazardous substance, and so we thought that these beautiful plants can help us with our problems.</font></p>
